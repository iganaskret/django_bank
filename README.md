For Mandatory Assignment 1, we have designed and developed a banking system in Django.

These are the requirements for our system:

1. A customer can have any number of bank accounts
2. For future multi-factor authentication, we must record the customer's telephone number
3. The bank ranks its customers into three groups: basic, silver, and gold - the system must keep track of this information
4. Customers ranked silver and gold can loan money from the bank
5. Customers can make payments on their loans
6. Customers can transfer money from their accounts if the account balance is sufficient
7. Customers can view their accounts, accounts movements, and accounts balance
8. Bank employees can view all customers and accounts
9. Bank employees can create new customers and accounts and change customer rank
10. Use Python 3.7 or newer, Django 3.0 or newer

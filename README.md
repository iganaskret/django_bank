For Mandatory Assignment 1, we have designed and developed a banking system in Django.

These are the requirements for our system:

A customer can have any number of bank accounts
For future multi-factor authentication, we must record the customer's telephone number
The bank ranks its customers into three groups: basic, silver, and gold - the system must keep track of this information
Customers ranked silver and gold can loan money from the bank
Customers can make payments on their loans
Customers can transfer money from their accounts if the account balance is sufficient
Customers can view their accounts, accounts movements, and accounts balance
Bank employees can view all customers and accounts
Bank employees can create new customers and accounts and change customer rank
Use Python 3.7 or newer, Django 3.0 or newer
